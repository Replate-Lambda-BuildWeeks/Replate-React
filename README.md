<h2>The Front End React App for the Lambda School Replate Build Weeks Project September, 2019</h2>

<h3>Problem: Many businesses have leftover food at the end of the day. Businesses end up disposing of good food that other people are in need of. There needs a be a way for businesses to connect with people who can take food from the businesses and deliver to places where food is needed.</h3>

<h3>Solution: Replate is an app that allows businesses to post excess leftover food items. Volunteers on the platform are notified of any available food items for pickup and can come pick up the food and take it to a predetermined place of need.</h3>
